# Kirby Sortable Action Add
Example on how to extend the [sortable](https://github.com/lukaskleinschmidt/kirby-sortable) field.  
This plugin will replace the default sortable `add` action with this custom one.  
It is basically just a copy of the internal sortable `add` action with some extra fields.

## Installation

The plugin folder must be named `sortable-action-add`.

```
